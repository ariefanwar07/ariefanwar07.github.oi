            <p>This is the original chart, sourced from NBC2, showing viewer concern levels about the Zika virus. Although it conveys the data, it is misleading because the actual values do not match the visual representation. Additionally, the dark background and low color contrast reduce readability.</p>        
            
            <h3>Replicated "Bad" Chart</h3>
            <figure id="cc4_replication_bad_chart"></figure>
            <p>This chart is a replica of the original design, created using Vega-Lite. It retains the same misleading structure, as the visual representation does not accurately reflect the data values. This replication allows us to identify the areas needing improvement, such as adjusting the data representation and improving readability.</p>
        
            <h3>Improved Chart</h3>
            <figure id="cc4_improved_chart"></figure>
            <p>The improved chart corrects the misleading aspects by accurately representing the data with clear labels and appropriate scaling. It also uses a clean color scheme, removes unnecessary background elements, and adds clear axis titles. Data labels are positioned above each bar for easy reading, ensuring that the chart accurately reflects viewer concern levels without distortion.</p>

                    <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> I converted the `quote_date` column to a datetime format and handled missing values by dropping incomplete rows.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Aggregation:</strong> I calculated the average monthly price of basmati rice using a group-by operation.</li>
