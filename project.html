            <h2> Economic and Urban Population Patterns </h2>
            <p>
                This chart visualizes the relationship between GDP per capita (PPP) and urban population percentages for countries around the world. 
                It highlights disparities in economic development and urbanization across regions such as Africa, Asia, Europe, the Americas, and Oceania.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using a log scale for GDP per capita, the chart makes it easier to compare countries with vast economic differences.

            <p>
                By adjusting the year slider, users can explore how these patterns have evolved over time, revealing trends in economic growth and 
                urbanization.
