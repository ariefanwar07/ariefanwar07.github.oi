                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Urban population refers to people living in urban areas as defined by national statistical offices. Explosive growth of cities globally signifies the demographic transition from rural to urban, and is associated with shifts from an agriculture-based economy to mass industry, technology, and service. 
                    In principle, cities offer a more favorable setting for the resolution of social and environmental problems than rural areas. Cities generate jobs and income, and deliver education, health care, and other services. 
                    Cities also present opportunities for social mobilization and women's empowerment.

                <h2>Economic and Urban Population Patterns</h2>
                <p>
                    This chart visualizes the relationship between GDP per capita (PPP) and urban population percentages for countries around the world. 
                    It highlights disparities in economic development and urbanization across regions such as Africa, Asia, Europe, the Americas, and Oceania.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using a log scale for GDP per capita, the chart makes it easier to compare countries with vast economic differences.
